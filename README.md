# Face-Recognition-Tensorflow
Jupyter Notebook Guide for implementing Face Recognition and Face Verification algorithms with Tensorflow framework.

- Face_Recognition library used for detecting faces
- Code involves implementation of triple loss function, togather with implementation of face verification and recognition algorithms
- Inspired from deeplearning.ai Specialization Assignment and uses pre-trained model from the course for encoding images to 128 dimensional embedding vectors.
