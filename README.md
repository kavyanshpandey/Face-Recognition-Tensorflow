# Face-Recognition-Tensorflow :performing_arts:

Jupyter Notebook Guide for implementing Face Recognition and Face Verification algorithms with Tensorflow framework.

- Face Recognition library used for detecting landmarks on faces.
- Code involves implementation of triple loss function, togather with implementation of face verification and face recognition algorithms.
- Inspired from deeplearning.ai Specialization Assignment and used pre-trained models and some of the utility functions from the course
- Encoded images to 128 dimensional embedding vectors.
